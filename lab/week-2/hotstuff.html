    <h1>Dutch Ovens Show a Sweeter Side</h1>
    <h6>By Jameson Montgomery</h6>
    <p>The name Dutch oven is a bit of a misnomer; it was actually the English foundryman Abraham Darby who patented the process of casting iron cookware in sand molds in 1707, though to be fair he was inspired by a trip to Holland, where he observed similar methods for making brassware, which he recreated back home using much cheaper iron. (In Dutch, the pots are simply called braadpan, meaning roasting pan.) Almost two centuries later in 1891, Johannes Berk Van Kampen (himself a Hollander) began coating the pots in enamel, making them easier to maintain and allowing them to be painted in vivid hues. That tradition continues this Valentineâ€™s Day with a pair of limited-edition Dutch ovens made by the kitchenware supplier Great Jones in collaboration with the New York-based ceramist and illustrator Laura Chautin. After she connected with the Great Jones co-founder Sierra Tishgart on Instagram, Chautin created a series of botanical designs that include daffodil, tulip and lily of the valley flowers hand-printed on two sizes: The larger Dutchess comes in white enamel and the Dutch Baby (half the size of the Dutchess) is in a bubble gum pink. Culinary-inclined sweethearts are likely to swoon; Chautin herself recently used one to make spaghetti pomodoro with mushrooms for a dinner party, to rave reviews.
