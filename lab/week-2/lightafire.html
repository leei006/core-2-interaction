    <h6>Light My Fire</h6>
    <h1>Incense Matches and Trompe L’Oeil Candles
    </h1>
    <h6>By Jamie Sims</h6>
    <p>In the winter months, I tend to favor candlelight over electricity in the evenings. If I have to endure the season’s early sunsets and freezing temperatures, at least I can make it cozy (and complexion-flattering) inside. Scented candles can grow cloying after a few hours, so I prefer scented matches — they still lend a sense of occasion to lighting up, but their smell won’t linger long enough to give you a headache. The yuzu incense matches from Hibi are my favorite — the brand was created by Kobe Match Company, which has been producing matches in Japan since 1929. Each one lasts about 10 minutes, and a pad for safe burning is included in the box. I also like Bohème’s Marisol fragrance — its notes of cardamom, clove and sandalwood are infused into extra-long matchsticks. For a touch of old-world charm, Buly is a classic choice: The brand’s perfumed matches come in eight signature scents and are housed in beautifully illustrated boxes. Any of these options would make a charming Valentine’s Day gift paired with a whimsical candle from Wednesday Company. Handmade by the Bronx-based Grace Battista, these playful depictions of croissants, baguettes and fruit look good enough to eat. And they’re unscented, so you can enjoy them long into the night.</p>
