    <h1>Ceramic Tomatoes That Look Fresh From the Garden</h1>
    <h6>By Ella Riley-Adams</h6>
    <p>When the London-based ceramist Yasmin Falahat began selling her pieces in 2018, she was focused on making figs and pomegranates inspired by her Iranian and Turkish Cypriot heritage. She shaped the fruits as if they’d been cut in half and hand-painted the seeds inside. As her business grew, she expanded her offerings with cantaloupe bowls and mushroom incense holders. In the fall, she released a set of miniature pumpkins that seemed real at first glance. July 2023 saw the arrival of trompe l’oeil tomatoes, their mottled surface catching the light in an uncanny imitation of the fruit’s skin. When the green stem is removed, the tomato becomes a candleholder, though Falahat notes her customers have also used the space to hold salt or olive oil. “I love the idea of everyday functional objects being beautiful or fun because it makes the everyday a little more joyful,” she says. Falahat releases new items in limited drops that tend to sell out quickly. Her next batch of tomatoes (along with pomegranate and fig dishes) will be available on Feb. 4 at 1 p.m. E.S.T.
