    <h6>Silver Linings</h6>
    <h1>An Unforgettable Pillbox</h1>
    <h6>By Coco Romack</h6>
    <p>Without my husband to nudge me to take my Estradiol tablets each morning, I wouldn’t be half the woman I am today — hormonally speaking, at least. His routine reminder has become a kind of everyday love language, a small and simple gesture that tells me he cares about my health and well-being. But when he’s not around, or if he’s slept through his alarm, I turn to my pill organizer, one of those flimsy plastic cases with slots for every day of the week, that I picked up from a pharmacy down the block from my apartment. Various brands have updated this classic form — Port and Polish’s iteration comes in lilac, mint and blush pink with compact mirrors inside — but this year, I’m eyeing something a little more imaginative. Casa Shop, a home-goods boutique in Richmond, Va., stocks vintage silver pillboxes shaped like candy and strawberries. Tiffany & Co. also offers luxurious sterling silver cases (with the option to personalize them with engraving), as does the Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Sophie Buhai, who fashions hers as a nautilus shell. And Judith Leiber Couture riffs on its signature crystal-clad minaudière handbags with surreal pillboxes disguised as lipsticks, martini glasses and gummy bears. Millions of Americans take prescription medication, so I can’t be the only one in need of a better vessel; these pillboxes are hard to forget.
