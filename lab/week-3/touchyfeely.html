    <p class="bL">A Valentine’s bouquet won’t seem like the obvious choice when it comes with a striking vase. The Italian designer and architect Gaetano Pesce’s Indian Summer Vessel looks like glass, but it’s molded out of pliable resin, making it an ideal gift for both the design-obsessed and the clumsy. Though the squiggly silhouette comes in various colors, the white iteration will complement any vibrant floral hue. For those who don’t mind the flowers playing second fiddle, Pesce’s Nugget Vessel — composed of colorful layers resembling molten lava, dotted with globs — doubles as a stand-alone sculpture. The Australian designer Tabitha Hope makes a different kind of soft vase: Hers are hand-tufted with acrylic yarn. Consider the Square Squiggle Pot to give your partner’s favorite pothos plant a cozy coat, or add a fluffy finishing touch to an otherwise mundane bouquet with the Lu vase in pink and red. The gift of flowers may be short-lived, but these vases will leave a lasting impression.
