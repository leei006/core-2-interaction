    <p class="bL">One-of-a-kind jewelry usually outshines the mass-produced variety, especially when it comes with a back story. In his Revive collection, the Japanese designer Yuta Ishihara makes the old new again by taking settings from cocktail rings, mostly from the 1980s, and resetting them onto modern wide bands. The original pieces are sourced by the designer in the city of Yamanashi, where he was born, then reset on new platinum or gold bands that give each ring a futuristic look. The New York-based designer Brent Neale looks closer to home — your home — for her custom pieces that use children’s artwork as a starting point. Drawings and sweet notes can be engraved onto 18-karat gold hearts that dangle from necklaces or bracelets. Self-portraits can be imagined as charms, too. The sky’s the limit for more fanciful works: For one client, a chicken originally made from feathers, googly eyes and pipe cleaners was recreated in rose gold, rhodochrosite and colored sapphires. Neale is always taking custom orders, but a dedicated service called Mini Masterpieces will officially launch this spring.
