Under the "Display: Grid" feature I added a 3x3 grid of fruit imgs outlined with a 1px solid border. 

"Display: Flex" is demonstrated in the color block at the top of the webpage. I used the style "justify content: space-between" to make the topbar squares equidistant from one another. 

"Position: Absolute" is demonstrated by the farmer icon in the left of the viewport. As you scroll down the farmer stays in place. 

"Position Relative" is demonstrated by the fruit imgs to center them within the outlined black grid boxes.
