    <div class="question">
        <p>Of these the one but the first and the most the completely <u>most uninteresting</u> is the question mark.</p>
        <p>The <span class="character">?</span> is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely <u>uninteresting.</u></p>
        <p>It is evident that is you ask a <span class="character">?</span> you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.</p>
        <p>Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <span class="character">?</span>.</p>
        <p>Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an <u>unnecessary</u> name of something.</p>
        <p>A <span class="character">?</span> is a <span class="character">?</span>, anybody can know that a <span class="character">?</span> is a <span class="character">?</span> and so why add to it the <span class="character">?</span> when it is already there when the <span class="character">?</span> is already there in the writing</p>
        <p>Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <span class="character">?</span>, I always found it <u>positively revolting</u>,and now very few do use it.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="excl"><span class="character">!</span> have the same difficulty and also <span class="character">"</span>, they are <u>unnecessary</u>, they are <u>ugly</u>, they <u>spoil</u> the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a <span class="character">?</span> is a <span class="character">?</span> what is the use of its being a <span class="character">?</span>. The same thing is true of a <span class="character">"</span>. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use <span class="character">?</span> and <span class="character">"</span> and <span class="character">!</span> and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</h2>

    <h2 class="transition">So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting.They might if one felt that way about them. 
    </h2>
    <h2 class="next">One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the <a href="..//apostrophe/apostrophe.html"><span class="character">'</span></a> for possession.</h2>
