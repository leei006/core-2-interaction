    <h2>Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, <span class="special">physically one had to again and again stop sometime</span> and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist<span class="character">.</span> Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did<span class="character">.</span> Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them<span class="character">.</span> I really never stopped using them<span class="character">.</span>
    Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it<span class="character">.</span> By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own<span class="character">.</span> They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own<span class="character">.</span>They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and <a href="../colonsemi/colonsemi.html"><span class="characterlink">:</span> <span class="characterlink">;</span></a> do<span class="character">.</span> Yes you do feel what I mean<span class="character">.</span>
    Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own<span class="character">.</span> And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them<span class="character">.</span>
